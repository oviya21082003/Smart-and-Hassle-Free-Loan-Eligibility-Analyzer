# Smart and Hassle-Free Loan Eligibility Analyzer
This project focuses on developing a machine learning-based loan eligibility prediction system for house, personal, and business loans. The system enhances loan approval efficiency, minimizes default risks, and ensures fair and data-driven decision-making for financial institutions.

Key highlights of the project include:

* Implemented Logistic Regression, SVM, Decision Tree, Random Forest, Gradient Boosting, XGBoost, and Deep Learning (MLP, FNN) for accurate eligibility predictions.
- Applied SMOTE for data balancing, hyperparameter tuning, and feature optimization to improve model accuracy.
- Achieved 92.66% accuracy for personal loans, 91.16% for business loans, and 80.78% for house loans after model optimization.
- Streamlined loan processing, reducing manual effort and ensuring faster, more transparent approvals.
